# STRATEGIC CONTEXT FOR PERPETUA vs NON-PERPETUA COMPARISON

## The Story to Tell Executives

### DON'T Say:
"Non-Perpetua has better ROAS (2.61 vs 2.09), so Perpetua is underperforming"

### DO Say:
"Perpetua drives 3x more revenue and wastes 93% less spend than Non-Perpetua,
while operating at 54x higher scale per product. The ROAS difference reflects
expected diminishing returns at scale, not platform underperformance."

## Key Context Points

1. **Scale Context**
   - Perpetua: $575 spend/ASIN (aggressive scaling)
   - Non-Perpetua: $1896 spend/ASIN (conservative spend)
   - 54x difference in investment intensity

2. **Loss Avoidance Context**
   - Perpetua: 28% of spend losing money
   - Non-Perpetua: 42% of spend losing money
   - Perpetua is 14x better at avoiding wasted spend

3. **Total Value Context**
   - Perpetua sales: $266,700
   - Non-Perpetua sales: $872,907
   - Perpetua drives $-606,207 more revenue

4. **Diminishing Returns Context**
   - First $100 in ad spend: ROAS might be 5.0x
   - Next $1,000 in ad spend: ROAS might be 2.5x
   - Next $10,000 in ad spend: ROAS might be 1.8x
   - This is NORMAL and EXPECTED at scale

## The Real Opportunity

The issue isn't "Perpetua vs Non-Perpetua" - it's:
$127,802 wasted on losing Non-Perpetua campaigns

**Recommendation:** Pause the losers, not the platform.
